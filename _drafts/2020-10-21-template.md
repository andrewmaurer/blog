Schemes are a mathematical object that revolutionized mathematics in the mid-twentieth century. The idea is simple -- embed the category of commutative rings into a geometrically meaningful category. From this, we will use geometric notions such as the Hausdorff property and compactness to study purely ring-theoretic behavior. Simply put, we start with a functor 

$$\operatorname{Spec}: \mathbf{Ring}^{op} \to \mathbf{Sch}$$

and investigate the hell out of that.

>> double code?

```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
return "Counting is for dweebs"
```
