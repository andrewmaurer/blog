excerpt: Groups are procedures which can be undone, i.e. invertible functions. By exploring this hands-on view, we arrive at an intuitive definition of a group.

Perhaps the most fundamental mathematical object is the function. As we know, a function $$f$$ has a domain $$A$$, from which it takes its input, and its codomain $$B$$, where the output lives. We express that $$f$$ is a function from $$A$$ to $$B$$ by writing $$f:A \to B$$. If $$f:A \to B$$ and $$g:B \to C$$, we can compose the two functions to get a single function, called $$ g \circ f : A \to C$$.

Our intuition tells us that functions correspond to procedures -- you
