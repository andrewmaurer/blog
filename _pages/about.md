Hello! I am Andrew, a Massachusetts native currently working on my mathematics PhD student at the [University of Georgia](http://uga.edu). I research algebra, namely representation theory and support variety theory for Lie superalgebras.

This is my blog, and I'll write here about things that interest me. That includes mathematics, science, pedagogy, programming, statistics, data, and (from time to time) politics.

I managed to get Facebook comments enabled for my posts, so be sure to leave your thoughts in the comments section!
